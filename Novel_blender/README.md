<h2>Novel Blender Generator</h2>

Hi there! With this program you can pick .txt files to "blend" together using a markov chain to make a whacky new story!

This was inspired by Zach Whalen's NanoGenMo Challenge Markovify code - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeL1u7n2d2s

To run this program, you'll need:

<ul>
<li>Python 3+</li>
<li>Random</li>
<li>Markovify</li>
<li>Reportlab</li>
<li>Tkinter</li>
</ul>
